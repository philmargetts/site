<p>I sat down at the piano again the other day, making it the first time in quite a while. Expecting something pretty rough, I was surprised to notice a more sensitve and considered touch than I remembered (forunately, someone else was listening in and could confirm this feeling).</p>
<p>I pondered on this for a little while, and noted that I'd been playing significantly more guitar in the last 12 months. Guitar being my main instrument, I summised that focussing my musical efforts in one direction allowed me to mature musically without worrying - to as great a degree - about how to "format" the musical syntax for the instrument. Musicians who have dabbled in instruments outside of their primary focus will understand this, I think. This musical maturation achieved on the guitar then translated across to the piano.</p>
<p>Now what is this syntax? I suggest you watch Adam's video :)</p>

<p>I also played the drums for the first time in six months a few weeks before, and I think a similar observation held true then, as well.</p>
<p><em>Now am I a master pianist or drummer (or guitarist, for that matter)? Definitely not, but I found this observation interesting nonetheless.</em></p>
