<h1>A new blog (again)</h1>
<small>[<a href='../2019.html#a-new-blog-again'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='a-new-blog-again.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>It is with <a href="https://philmargetts.github.io/wordpress-archive/and-so-it-begins-a-new-blog/index.html">some nostalgia</a> that I write another introductory blog post... Hosted back on GitHub pages, no less!</p>

<p>As mentioned on the home page, what I didn't like about my implementation of WordPress was that it put me in a box. And considering a future where I am likely to diversify outside of educational technology, I wanted a personal site that could be a <strong>reflection of me more holistically</strong>. Having a site dedicated to "work things" is great, but as the home page says, I'd like a place where I also can jot down thoughts and be able to look back on how they (I) have evolved. I must admit there is also some attraction to having a web presence outside of mainstream social media, where there is more control - and I can have a basic HTML site if I want to!</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out!</p>
