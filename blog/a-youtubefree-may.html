<h1>A YouTube-free May</h1>
<small>[<a href='../2019.html#a-youtubefree-may'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='a-youtubefree-may.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>Although I've gotten better at social media, I feel I watch too many YouTube videos; time that could be better spent taking a break from thinking - Lord knows I do too much of that! - and spent being "at rest", praying, or being generally more productive (might post some more of my recent ponderings).</p>

<p>See how it goes! Will check back in month. Would be curious to hear others' experiences, if anyone stumbles across this site.</p>
