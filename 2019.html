<p>As buggy as Teams is, this is pretty cool. Shows the power of an "ecosystem" suite of tools working together at UNSW.</p>

<p>I've briefly commented on our much more modest use of Teams previously, <a href="https://philmargetts.github.io/wordpress-archive/journey-from-gmail-to-office-365-itmel-post/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id='i-got-better-at-piano-by-not-playing-for-a-year'>I got better at piano by not playing for a year</h2>
<small>[<a href='#i-got-better-at-piano-by-not-playing-for-a-year'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/i-got-better-at-piano-by-not-playing-for-a-year.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>I sat down at the piano again the other day, making it the first time in quite a while. Expecting something pretty rough, I was surprised to notice a more sensitve and considered touch than I remembered (forunately, someone else was listening in and could confirm this feeling).</p>
<p>I pondered on this for a little while, and noted that I'd been playing significantly more guitar in the last 12 months. Guitar being my main instrument, I summised that focussing my musical efforts in one direction allowed me to mature musically without worrying - to as great a degree - about how to "format" the musical syntax for the instrument. Musicians who have dabbled in instruments outside of their primary focus will understand this, I think. This musical maturation achieved on the guitar then translated across to the piano.</p>
<p>Now what is this syntax? I suggest you watch Adam's video :)</p>

<p>I also played the drums for the first time in six months a few weeks before, and I think a similar observation held true then, as well.</p>
<p><em>Now am I a master pianist or drummer (or guitarist, for that matter)? Definitely not, but I found this observation interesting nonetheless.</em></p>

<h2 id='a-youtubefree-may'>A YouTube-free May</h2>
<small>[<a href='#a-youtubefree-may'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/a-youtubefree-may.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>Although I've gotten better at social media, I feel I watch too many YouTube videos; time that could be better spent taking a break from thinking - Lord knows I do too much of that! - and spent being "at rest", praying, or being generally more productive (might post some more of my recent ponderings).</p>

<p>See how it goes! Will check back in month. Would be curious to hear others' experiences, if anyone stumbles across this site.</p>

<h2 id='a-new-blog-again'>A new blog (again)</h2>
<small>[<a href='#a-new-blog-again'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/a-new-blog-again.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>It is with <a href="https://philmargetts.github.io/wordpress-archive/and-so-it-begins-a-new-blog/index.html">some nostalgia</a> that I write another introductory blog post... Hosted back on GitHub pages, no less!</p>

<p>As mentioned on the home page, what I didn't like about my implementation of WordPress was that it put me in a box. And considering a future where I am likely to diversify outside of educational technology, I wanted a personal site that could be a <strong>reflection of me more holistically</strong>. Having a site dedicated to "work things" is great, but as the home page says, I'd like a place where I also can jot down thoughts and be able to look back on how they (I) have evolved. I must admit there is also some attraction to having a web presence outside of mainstream social media, where there is more control - and I can have a basic HTML site if I want to!</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out!</p>

<p>(Thanks also to <a href="http://lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a> who's <code>lb</code> <a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/lb">shell script</a> I'll probably use for generating posts/pages.)</p>
