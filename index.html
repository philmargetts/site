<h1>Phil Margetts</h1>
<p>clicker of things. strummer of strings. follower of Jesus.</p>

<p><em>Continually under development! <a href="http://wordpress.philmargetts.com">'Old' WordPress site still available</a>, for now.</em></p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>For sharing and recording thoughts in a form where there isn't this unspoken pressure to have them perfectly displayed and completely thought-through that come with the typical modern website. The premise of this site: a repository to store the development of my thinking...</p>

<p><em>Why is this site <a href="ugly.html">'ugly'? -></a></em>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Phil and I’m currently employed as an IT Pro in education and finishing a Bachelor's degree in IT and Business. <p>
<p>I have a passion to see technology help people in their day-to-day. In the education space, learning is the goal. Technology should be there to support the learning, not direct it. </p>

<blockquote>An analogy I enjoy sharing is that <strong>technology is just a tool</strong> that can be used for good or not so good. Just think: a hammer can be used to build a house or bludgeon someone to death!</blockquote>

<p>Quick facts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Study, and serve on the Academic and Study Area of Information Technology Boards at the University of Southern Queensland</li>
	<li>Current member of the leadership team and co-founder of the <a href="http://usqitsn.org">USQ IT Students’ Network</a></li>
	<li>Church/band member here: Toowoomba North Church of Christ (I’m also often found here: HumeRidge Church of Christ)</li>
