<h1>Why is this site 'ugly'?</h1>

 <p>Fundamentally, function over form. In my option, having a functional, readable site puts much more emphasis on the content, rather than the presentation. I guess this reflects my belief that technology is a tool. Does [insert generally-disregarded solution] do the job well enough? Great!</p>
