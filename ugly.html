<h1>Why is this site 'ugly'?</h1>

<p>Fundamentally, function over form (while being very mindful of the application!)</p>
<p>In my option, having a functional, readable site puts much more emphasis on the content, rather than the presentation. I guess this reflects my belief that fundamentally, technology is a tool. Does [insert generally-disregarded solution] perform the task required? Great!</p>
<p>Am I suggesting this is best practice for every site? Definitely not, but we'll see how it goes for this one.</p>
